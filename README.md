# An Introduction to Domain-Driven Design and Event Sourcing

#### AKA Build a Pragmatic Domain-Driven Design and Event Sourcing Application Workshop

During this workshop we will collaborate, design, and implement a solution that will result in a working, business-focused, event-driven application in modern C# ([dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)).

This workshop aims to provide a high-level introduction to concepts such as Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), and Event Sourcing. We will build upon these concepts and how they can aid each other, along with their design and usage in software solutions and an analysis of their associated risks.

**TL;DR: obtain a pragmatic understanding of these concepts and applying them**
